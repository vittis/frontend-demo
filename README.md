# Front-end Demo

The purpose of this demo is to showcase my front-end developer skills and my ability to follow methodologies and guidelines as I develop a premade design.

## Stack decision making

The main technologies and methodologies used were: 

* BEM naming convention methodology ([https://en.bem.info/](https://en.bem.info/)) 
* SASS 7-1 Architeture Pattern ([https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern](https://sass-guidelin.es/#the-7-1-pattern))

You may ask: Why not use a css/js framework like Bootstrap, MaterializeCSS or jQuery? Or even some popular modular javascript library like React or Vue?
First of all, I like to keep it simple. Adding complexity for the sake of the sake of adding complexity has led many developers to deep problems, including myself. Not to tell the extra load times it comes with such additions.

Of course every project has its own needs, and there are a lot of contexts that the adoption of such frameworks are justificable and encouraged. I surely would use Bootstrap for some rapid prototyping, for example.

I'm just pointing out that I'm not dependant on such frameworks, I can write readable, extensible and reusable code with native tech, which, on my vision, is a very important skill to have, that was the main point of this demo.

As the project evolves I would be sure to integrate **webpack** or a similar tool to the stack, as its benefits of module bundling and minification are priceless. And with it the **npm package manager** would be very well welcomed too. As a big fan of **Typescript** I would certainly consider using it, mainly if there was going on some heavy javascripting. I just felt that there were no necessity of adding such tools right now.
